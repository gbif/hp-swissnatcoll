# What is a Data Aggregator?

A data aggregator is a tool that collects data from multiple, heterogeneous sources and integrates them into a coherent, aggregated format, which can then be used for processing, publishing, and ensuring compliance with the [FAIR principles](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/){:target="_blank"}.

Aggregating and publishing specimen data offers museums and other collection-holding institutions significant advantages, especially as global data resources continue to grow. By sharing their records in a unified system, they can collaborate more effectively and benefit from access to large, diverse datasets. This broader perspective helps researchers identify patterns, connections, and trends that might remain hidden in isolated collections.

# DAGI

DAGI is the Swiss data aggregator for biological and paleontological specimen data. Designed as a collaborative tool, it aggregates, standardizes and enriches data supplied by natural history institutions–automating time-consuming processes–and provides a straight gate to publish data in GBIF.
