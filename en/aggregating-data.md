# What is a Data Aggregator?

A data aggregator is a tool that collects data from multiple, heterogeneous sources and integrates them into a coherent, aggregated dataset, which can then be used for processing, publishing, and ensuring compliance with the [FAIR principles](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/){:target="_blank"}.

Aggregating and publishing specimen data offers museums significant advantages, especially as global data resources continue to grow. By sharing their records in a unified system, museums can collaborate more effectively and benefit from access to large, diverse datasets. This broader perspective helps researchers identify patterns, connections, and trends that might remain hidden in isolated collections. For museums, aggregated data also supports curatorial work—such as tracking specimens, improving documentation and cleaning databases, as well as planning exhibitions—and can even enhance visitor engagement through more personalized and data-informed experiences.

# DAGI

DAGI is the Swiss data aggregator for biological and paleontological specimen data. Designed as a collaborative tool for Swiss natural history institutions, it facilitates dataflows between collections by aggregating, standardising, and enriching the specimen data they supply and host.
