# How to publish data with the Data Aggregator DAGI

<div style="padding: 15px; border: 1px solid transparent; margin-bottom: 20px; border-radius: 4px; color: #31708f; background-color: #d9edf7; border-color: #bce8f1;">
‚ÑπÔ∏è A new version has been recently released on DAGI üéâ This page is in the work to be updated to the new features of this update. We hope you understand if something has not yet been corrected. [09.07.2025]
</div>

**In order to publish your data on [GBIF.org](https://www.gbif.org/){:target="_blank"} and have it displayed on the SwissNatColl hosted portal**, you need to first prepare an import file with all the data you want to publish (see [Prepare my data](#prepare-my-data) here below).

After preparing it, you are ready to [log in](#log-in) and [import your data](#import-my-data) in the [Data Aggregator (DAGI) web app](https://dagi.gbif.ch/sign-in){:target="_blank"}. Then, when done with the [mapping](#map-my-data) and [encoding](#encode-my-data) of your data, the dataset is ready to be [published on GBIF.org](#publish-my-data). From there, it will be displayed on the SwissNatColl portal, in the [Occurrence data section](/occurrence/search){:target="_blank"}.

A feature currently in development will also allow you to [send your swiss data for validation](#validate-my-data) to the Infospecies data centers experts.

## Checklist -to do before logging in the Data Aggregator DAGI

<br>‚úÖ My **institution** is **registered on [GRSciColl](https://scientific-collections.gbif.org/institution/search?country=CH){:target="_blank"}**.

> Example: [Conservatoire et Jardin botaniques de Gen√®ve](https://scientific-collections.gbif.org/institution/d200fcbc-972e-4488-bcb6-eaa47209148d){:target="_blank"}

‚ö†Ô∏è If your institution is not registered on GRSciColl, please contact [GBIF Swiss Node](mailto:contact@gbif.ch).

<br>‚úÖ My **collection** is **registered in my institution on [GRSciColl](https://scientific-collections.gbif.org/collection/search?country=CH){:target="_blank"}**.

> Example: [Herbarium ‚Äì De Candolle's Prodromus](https://scientific-collections.gbif.org/collection/8d09b714-dbb5-4dda-976f-f2f804421f02){:target="_blank"}

‚ö†Ô∏è If your collection is not registered on GRSciColl or it needs adjustments, please contact [GBIF Swiss Node](mailto:contact@gbif.ch).


<br>‚úÖ **At least [one Collection Administrator of my institution](/en/data-aggregator-faqs#what-are-the-different-roles-of-the-user-profile-on-the-data-aggregator){:target="_blank"}** is already **registered in DAGI**.

‚ö†Ô∏è If your institution does not yet have a Collection Administrator, please send a request email to [contact-swissnatcoll@infofauna.ch](mailto:contact-swissnatcoll@infofauna.ch) with your full name, institution role, institution email and institution name.

<br>‚úÖ My import file has all **mandatory fields** (attributes) **correctly informed** to ensure successfull import in DAGI.
> - scientificName ([definition](https://dwc.tdwg.org/terms/#dwc:scientificName){:target="_blank"})
> - catalogNumber ([definition](https://dwc.tdwg.org/terms/#dwc:catalogNumber){:target="_blank"})

<br>‚úÖ My import file is an **UTF-8 encoded csv or text file with comma or tab separation** and **[Darwin Core standardised columns and cell content](/en/data-dwc#where-can-i-find-the-darwin-core-terms-description){:target="_blank"}**.
> catalogNumber     scientificName     eventDate     recordedBy     ...<br>
> XXX-123456789     Poa annua L.     2024-10-09     Weber Morgan     ...<br>
> ...      ...     ...      ...     ...<br>
> XXX-234567890     Poa annua L.     2024-10-08     Weber Morgan     ...

‚ö†Ô∏è Darwin Core headers are not mandatory in the import file, but it allows you to benefit from the auto-mapping, or else you will have to do the mapping manually for each field in your import file.

<br>‚úÖ My import file has a **maximum size of 800 Mbyte (= 800 Mo)**.

<br>

<div style="padding: 15px; border: 1px solid transparent; margin-bottom: 20px; border-radius: 4px; color: #31708f; background-color: #d9edf7; border-color: #bce8f1;">
<strong>üëå You can do as many data imports as you want</strong>.<br> The Data Aggregator tracks all imported files, even if they contain the same data. <strong>If your catalogNumber remains unchanged, each new import will update the corresponding existing data</strong>.
</div>

## Prepare my data

1. Focus on the **most important fields** first ([Mandatory fields](/en/data-aggregator-faqs#minimal-mandatory-fields-of-the-data-aggregator){:target="_blank"}, [MIDS fields](/en/data-aggregator-faqs#additional-fields-increasing-data-quality-in-the-data-aggregator-mids){:target="_blank"}) and then proceed with the ones you think are **important/interesting to be made publicly available**.
   - You don't need to import your entire database into the Aggregator. Some of your fields are purely internal management. <br>
2. Make sure the [fields which require special values in DAGI](/en/data-aggregator-faqs#fields-in-the-data-aggregator-with-special-values-required){:target="_blank"} are filled in correctly.
3. Check that your file does not have
   - catalogNumber duplicates
   - empty scientificName or catalogNumber cells
   - duplicated headers or un-titled columns
   - an unwanted space after a header
  
‚ö†Ô∏è There are fields that are not available for mapping because they are added by DAGI automatically : _institutionCode_, _institutionID_, _collectionCode_, _collectionID_ and _datasetID_. These attributes are based on GRSciColl and GBIF.


Please refer to our [FAQs](/en/data-aggregator-faqs){:target="_blank"} for more details on preparing your data for import into DAGI.

There are two different views on your institution page:

  - **[Datasets](#datasets-view)**: displays all the **datasets** of your institution already added in DAGI.
  - **[Administration](#administration-view)**: ‚ö†Ô∏èvisible only to _Collection Administrators_ ‚ö†Ô∏è, displays all **users** already added to your institution.

There are also two icons opening pages on the SwissNatColl portal with support material to help you using DAGI.

  - **[Guide](#guide)**: opens the *How to publish data with the Data Aggregator* **page** on the SwissNatColl hosted portal (this page)
  - **[Tutorials](#tutorials)**: opens the *Tutorial sessions for the Data Aggregator users* **page** on the SwissNatColl hosted portal

The terms of use you just accepted are at all times available by clicking on the last icon.

  - **[Terms&Conditions](#terms--conditions)**: opens the *Terms of use* **page** on the SwissNatColl hosted portal

## Add a new dataset

<div style="padding: 15px; border: 1px solid transparent; margin-bottom: 20px; border-radius: 4px; color: #a94442; background-color: #f2dede; border-color: #ebccd1;">
‚ùå Only the <i>Collection Administrator</i> role can add, edit and delete datasets. The steps described in this section are unavailable for users with only the <i>Data Digitizer</i> role.
</div>

1. Go to the [Datasets view](#datasets-view) of your institution page by clicking on the **ü™üDatasets** icon on the left side of the window.
  - On this page, you can see all the datasets of your institution that have already been added in DAGI. The names of the datasets are based on the [GRSciColl collection names](https://scientific-collections.gbif.org/collection/search?country=CH){:target="_blank"}.
  - You can order the dataset list by clicking on the **columns titles** (_Name_, _Code_, _State_, _Institution Code_, _Institution_, _Records count / est._ and _Updated At_, see the [Datasets view paragraph](#datasets-view){:target="_blank"} for a precise description). By clicking twice or more, you can order them in an ascending or descending order.
  - The State column informs you of the process step currently running (_Importing_, _Encoding_, _Publishing_). Unless the State of a dataset is on "üïíReady", no other action can be started until the current one is executed. Depending on the number of records, it can take up to a few hours.
2. If your Datasets view is empty, click either on the **+ New dataset** button in the center of the window or on **ü™üNew dataset** on the top-right corner of the window (it does the same thing at this point).
3. If your Datasets view already has datasets, click on the **ü™üNew dataset** button in the top right corner of the window.

--- A pop-up window _New Dataset_ has opened. ---

1. Select the type of your data. ‚ö†Ô∏è**Mandatory**‚ö†Ô∏è
    - Available types: Zoology, Botany, Paleontology
2. Select the corresponding GRSciColl Collection of your institution. ‚ö†Ô∏è**Mandatory**‚ö†Ô∏è
    - If the GRSciColl collection has already been added on DAGI, it is not present anymore in the drop-down list of this pop-up window. You can find it on the Datasets view.
3. Add a description of the dataset. üí°optionalüí°
4. Click on **Create dataset**
    - If you change your mind, you can cancel and close the window at any time by clicking on **Cancel**.
    - If you want to edit a dataset, click on the üìùEdit icon of the dataset (far right-side of dataset line in the Datasets view)
    - If you want to delete a dataset, please take contact with us at [contact-swissnatcoll@infofauna.ch](mailto:contact-swissnatcoll@infofauna.ch), so we can advise you accordingly.
5. The pop-up window closes itself and you are now on the page of the dataset you just added.

<div style="text-align: center; margin-top: 50px; border: 5px solid #000; padding: 20px;">
  <p style="font-size: 20px;"><strong>What you expect to have at the end of this step:</strong></p>
  <p>‚úÖ A new dataset in the <strong>Datasets view</strong> of your institution</p>
</div>


## Import my data

<div style="padding: 15px; border: 1px solid transparent; margin-bottom: 20px; border-radius: 4px; color: #a94442; background-color: #f2dede; border-color: #ebccd1;">
‚ùå Only the <i>Data Digitizer</i> can do the following steps, from the import to the image upload. The steps described from here on are unavailable to users with only the <i>Collection Administrator</i> role.
</div>

1. Go to the [Datasets view](#datasets-view) of your institution page by clicking on **Datasets** on the left side of the window.
2. Click on the dataset name in which you want to import your data.
  - For each dataset in DAGI, you have 7 tabs, in a grey bar on top of the dataset page (_Records_, _Imports_, _Exports_, _Publications_,  _Validations_, _Image Upload_, _Published Records_) (see the [Dataset page paragraph](#dataset-page) for a precise description).
  - The tab **Records** displays the imported **records** available in the dataset.
  - The tab **Imports** displays all the **files** that have been imported.
  - The tab **Exports** displays all the **files** that have been exported.
  - The tab **Publications** displays all the **files** that have been published on GBIF.org
  - The tab **Validations** is still to be developped ‚ö†Ô∏è
  - The tab **Image Upload** displays all the **files** with images that have been uploaded.
  - The tab **Published Records** displays all the **records** that have been already published.
3. If your dataset is empty, click either on the **+ Import** button in the center of the window, or the **üì§Import data** button in the top-right corner of the window (it does the same thing at this point).
4. If your dataset already has records and you want to add new records or update the existing ones, click on the **üì§Import data** button in the top-right corner of the window.

--- A three-steps pop-up window _Import records_ has opened. ---

1. (Step 1Ô∏è‚É£ of 3Ô∏è‚É£) Click on **Choose a file** to select your prepared .csv/.txt file or drag and drop it if you have a folder window opened on your screen.
2. Wait until the purple bar is full.
3. Click on **Next**

### Map my data

The mappings window (Step 2Ô∏è‚É£ of 3Ô∏è‚É£) has three parts:
<div>
  <table style="border-collapse: collapse; border: 1px white">
      <tr>
          <td style="text-align: left; vertical-align: top"><i>Quick Start</i></td>
          <td>if your file headers are exactly the same as the DAGI attributes, the mapping can be automatically performed by <strong>‚ú®Try auto-mapping</strong>. The second button <strong>üîÑÔ∏èLoad existing mapping</strong> can be used after the first mapping. It maps your fields the same way you mapped them previously (as long as your file headers do not change).</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
          <td style="text-align: left; vertical-align: top"><i>Required attributes</i></td>
          <td>mandatory attributes that have to be mapped in order to go to the next step. Two attributes are mandatory in DAGI: <a href="https://dwc.tdwg.org/terms/#dwc:scientificName">scientificName</a> and <a href="https://dwc.tdwg.org/terms/#dwc:catalogNumber">catalogNumber</a>.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
          <td style="text-align: left; vertical-align: top"><i>Additional columns</i></td>
          <td>the other columns present in your import file. The button <strong>‚ûïAdd all</strong> is available for clicking. It adds all of your columns at once. Then you can select the corresponding DAGI attribute for each of them. You can also click directly on the <strong>grey area with the column name</strong> to add them one by one on top of the list of already mapped columns.</td>
      </tr>
  </table>
</div>


1. If your file headers are 100% the same as the DAGI's attribute, click on **‚ú®Try auto-mapping**.
2. If you already did a mapping of a previous file, click on **üîÑÔ∏èLoad existing mapping** and simply check the mapping before clicking on **Update mapping**.
3. If it is your first mapping and your file headers are different than the DAGI attributes, do first the _Required attributes_ by clicking on the drop-down menu **Select a column** on the right side of the attribute names. You can then select the corresponding header in your imported file.
  - By typing the beginning of your file header in the search bar, you can find it more easily.
  - If unsure of the correspondence between the attributes and your file headers, consult the Darwin Core FAQs section [Where can I find the Darwin Core terms description?](/en/data-dwc#where-can-i-find-the-darwin-core-terms-description){:target="_blank"}.
4. For the Additional columns, either click on **‚ûï Add all** or add them one by one by clicking on the attribute names (with grey background) to map your headers with the DAGI attributes.
  - The added attributes appear at the top of the Additional columns list when added one by one, and at the bottom of the list when added with ‚ûï Add all.
  - The unmapped headers of your file are listed on top of the Additional columns list with a grey background. It is not mandatory to map all of your file headers.
5. Repeat these steps until all of the headers you want to import are mapped.
  - If you can't find a DAGI attribute corresponding to one or more of your headers, you have the possibility to map it as a "Custom Attribute". ‚ö†Ô∏è Custom Attributes can't be encoded nor published on GBIF but may be available for other features in DAGI (e.g. Validation process)
<br>
6. When satisfied with your mapping, click on **Update mapping**.
<br>
7. (Step 3Ô∏è‚É£ of 3Ô∏è‚É£) The last step is a summary window on which you can check your file name and size, creation date, the number of rows, and the mapped and unmapped columns.
  - If you want to keep a trace of your mapping, you can select the whole summary window and copy-paste it on your computer. This might also help you keep track of the correspondance between your database file headers and the attributes of DAGI.
8. When satisfied, click on **Run import**.
  - The page displayed is now the Imports tab, where you can see all your imported files for a given dataset at all times. By clicking on the blue icon of the size (üì•xyz.x Mbyte), you can download your imported file.
  - A progression bar appears during the import process and disappears when finished. ‚ö†Ô∏è Depending on the size of your imported dataset, this step can take a few hours to be completed ‚ö†Ô∏è Closing your navigator has no impact on the process, you can come back later to check the import state.
  - If the import worked, the State is **‚úÖ Imported**
  - If the import did not work, the State is **‚ùå Failed**, you can check our [Error messages page](/en/dagi-error-messages#the-import-failed){:target="_blank"} for a precise description on what to do.
9. Click on the **Records** tab to see your imported records.
        
<div style="text-align: center; margin-top: 50px; border: 5px solid #000; padding: 20px;">
  <p style="font-size: 20px;"><strong>What you expect to have at the end of the Importing step:</strong></p>
  <p>‚úÖ Your imported records shown in the <strong>Records</strong> tab of your dataset page.</p>
</div>

## Encode my data

<div style="padding: 15px; border: 1px solid transparent; margin-bottom: 20px; border-radius: 4px; color: #31708f; background-color: #d9edf7; border-color: #bce8f1;">
<p>‚ÑπÔ∏è <strong>Encoding is not mandatory, though highly recommended</strong>, so that you can benefit from the enrichment offered by DAGI.</p>
<p>Despite not needed for publication or validation, supplementary mandatory attributes must be imported, because <strong>GBIF accepts new occurrences under certain conditions and some attributes are important for the correct attribution of a record to a Data Center</strong>.</p>
<p>The supplementary mandatory attributes are <i>kingdom</i> and <i>country</i>.</p>
</div>

1. If you want to encode only a certain set of your data, use the **available filters**.
  - **Quick-filters**: Below the grey tab band, there are four boxes displaying from left to right: the total number of records (**All records**), the percentage and number of not-encoded records (**Not encoded / Incomplete**), the percentage and number of not-published records (**Not published**) and the percentage and number of not-validated records (**Not validated**). By selecting one, you can set a first level of filters.
  - **üîçSearch**: Below the Quick-filters, there is a search bar which allows you to look for specific values in the following attributes : _cataloNumber_, _scientificName_ and _occurrenceID_.
  - **üéöÔ∏èFilters**: Next to the search bar, there is the Filters button which opens a pop-up window with available filters grouped in four categories: Taxonomy, Date, Location and Other. Please check the [Filters paragraph](#filters){:target="_blank"} for a precise description.
2. Click on **üß©Encode**.
  - A pop-up window _Encoding Summary_ opens with a short summary of what the encoding does. Briefly said, it uses some attributes as query values that are sent to available dictionaries of data (like GBIF API) to encode the provided values and enrich specific attributes with new values. It is extremely useful for taxonomic standardisation, georeferencing, species protection, etc. (see [What does the Encoding do? in the FAQs](/en/data-aggregator-faqs#what-does-the-encoding-do){:target="_blank"} for a precise description)
  - If you change your mind, you can cancel and close the window at any time by clicking on **Cancel**.
3. When satisfied with the set of records you want to encode, click on **Encode**.
  - A progression bar appears during the encoding process and disappears when launched. ‚ö†Ô∏è Depending on the number of your records, this step can take up to a day to be completed ‚ö†Ô∏è Closing your navigator has not impact on the process, you can come back later to check the encoding state.
  - During the encoding, no other action can be started.
4. Check the percentage of encoded data on your Dataset page (see the second box called **Not encoded / Incomplete**) in the Quick-filters.
  - By clicking on any **record**, and then on the **Encodings tab** of the side-pane, you can check the encoding state of all catalogs used for encoding and enriching your data (e.g. geo_reverse, swiss_species, gbif_taxonomy, etc.).
  - If the status is "Incomplete", the record is "Not encoded". The reason is displayed when placing the mouse on the yellow **‚ö†Ô∏èIncomplete** icon in the Encodings tab of the side-pane.

## Export my data

1. Click on **üì•Export**.
  - A pop-up window _Export Records_ opens and is composed of two parts: Data headers and Data layer.
2. **Select your data headers** allows you to determine the column names of your export file. You can choose between your original headers, as imported in the [Import my data](#import-my-data) part, or the Darwin Core (DWC) Attributes, which includes all available attributes in DAGI.
  - You can select only one at a time. If you want both types, export the records twice.<br>
3. **Select the data layer** allows you to determine which data values you want to export. You can choose between your imported data (Raw), as imported in the [Import my data](#import-my-data) part, or the encoded data (Encoded), as encoded in the [Encode my data](#encode-my-data) part.
   - You can select only one at a time. If you want both types, export the records twice.<br>
6. Click on **Start export**.
  - The page view changes from the Records tab to the Exports tab where all of your exported files are listed.
  - A progression bar appears during the export process and disappears when finished.<br>
3. Click on the **blue icon** (üì•xyz.x Mbyte) of your export file in the _Size_ column.
  - The file is now saved as a .zip file on your computer (usually in the Downloads folder or on your Desktop).<br>
4. Go to the zip file on your computer and extract the CSV file it contains.
  - A unique file name for this CSV file has been generated by DAGI.
  - Your data content is separated by commas.
  - The file is encoded in UTF-8. To facilitate the opening of the file, we recommend you use the _Get Data from a CSV file_ method directly in Excel. This way the UTF-8 format is set properly.

## Upload images

<div style="padding: 15px; border: 1px solid transparent; border-color: transparent; margin-bottom: 20px; border-radius: 4px; color: #8a6d3b;; background-color: #fcf8e3; border-color: #faebcc;">
‚ö†Ô∏è Only images that can be linked to an <strong>existing record</strong> in your DAGI dataset can be uploaded.<br>
  ‚ö†Ô∏è This feature is <strong>NOT for high definition images</strong>, but for enhancing the visibility of collections who don't have a publicly available image deposit webpage.
</div>

<br>

{: .box }
**If your images are already available online, simply add the url in the attribute [associatedMedia](https://dwc.tdwg.org/terms/#dwc:associatedMedia){:target="_blank"}.**

<br>

1. Prepare a ZIP file containing your specimen images.
- file name = your chosen attribute for mapping (recommended: **catalogNumber**)
- for records with several images, use the same file name but with an additionnal "_1", "_2", "_3", etc.
- file format = **JPG, JPEG, PNG, BMP, TIFF, SVG or WEBP**
- maximal file size = **5 Mb** (Mo)
- maximale ZIP file size = **200 Mb** (Mo)

2. Click on the **Image Upload** tab in the grey tab band of your dataset, then on **‚ûï Upload Images** in the middle of the page or on **üì§Upload Images** in the top-right corner of the page.

--- A three-steps pop-up window _Upload Images_ has opened. ---

1. (Step 1Ô∏è‚É£ of 3Ô∏è‚É£) Click on **Choose a file** to select your prepared ZIP file or drag and drop it if you have a folder window opened on your screen.
2. Wait until the purple bar is full.
3. Click on **Next**
4. (Step 2Ô∏è‚É£ of 3Ô∏è‚É£) Select in the drop-down menu **Mapping Identifier** the corresponding attribute to your file names.
5. Click on **Update mapping**
6. (Step 3Ô∏è‚É£ of 3Ô∏è‚É£) The last step is a summary window on which you can check your file name and size, creation date, the number of invalid files, and the mapped identifier.
7. Click on **Run Mapping** (if available).
<br>  - ‚ö†Ô∏è The State of your Image Upload might be currently on ‚öôÔ∏èExtracting. This means that the Mapping can't be run yet, even by clicking on it. As soon as the extraction is finished, you will need to come back and click (again) on **Run Mapping**. You can close your DAGI page in the meantime, or start the upload of another ZIP file.
9. You can check the status of your Image Upload
- **Finished** : All of your images could be mapped with a record in your dataset. By clicking on the green **‚úÖFinished** icon, a side-panel opens with the details of your Image Upload. In the Logfile section, you can click on the **üì• icon** which downloads a csv with the list of all the pictures of your ZIP file and the mapping status and attribute.
- **Incomplete** : All or a part of your images remained unmapped. This could be due to the name of the files and the values of the attribute you selected for the mapping. By clicking on the yellow **‚ö†Ô∏èIncomplete** icon, a side-panel opens with the details of your Image Upload. In the Logfile section, you can click on the **üì• icon** which downloads a csv with the list of all the pictures of your ZIP file and the mapping status and attribute.
- **Mapping failed** : None of your images could be mapped. By clicking on the red **‚ùåMapping failed** icon, a side-panel opens with the details of your Image Upload. However there is no logfile. The failure could be due to the name of the files and the values of the attribute you selected for the mapping. If the problem persists after multiple trials, do not hesitate to contact us.

Now, in the **Records tab** of your Dataset, the records with an image have a green camera icon, and you can see the image when opening the side-panel of a record (only the first image is displayed if multiple images have been mapped to the same record). The link to the DAGI Media Store has been added in the attribute *[associatedMedia](https://dwc.tdwg.org/terms/#dwc:associatedMedia){:target="_blank"}*. When publishing your data, the image will also be displayed on the GBIF occurrence page of your specimen.

The datasets displayed here are the ones that have been added by a Collection Administrator of your institution. You can only see the datasets of the institution you have been registered to upon creation of your user's profile. The datasets are organised by default by order of creation. If you wish to order them differently, you can click on any of the available headers and order them in an ascending or descending order:
- *Name*: name of your dataset as stated on [GRSciColl](https://scientific-collections.gbif.org/collection/search?country=CH){:target="_blank"} (collection name).
- *Code*: code of your dataset as stated on [GRSciColl](https://scientific-collections.gbif.org/collection/search?country=CH){:target="_blank"} (collectionCode).
- *State*: is green (üïíReady) when the previous action launched is finished and a new one can be started (Actions : [üì§import](#import-my-data), [üì•export](#export-my-data),  [üß©encode](#encode-my-data), [üåêpublish](#publish-my-data) and [‚úÖvalidate](#validate-my-data)).
- *Institution Code*: code of your institution as stated on [GRSciColl](https://scientific-collections.gbif.org/institution/search?country=CH){:target="_blank"} (institutionCode).
- *Institution*: name of your institution as stated on [GRSciColl](https://scientific-collections.gbif.org/institution/search?country=CH){:target="_blank"} (institution name).
- *Progress*: progress bar linked to the number of records already imported and the total number of specimens stated on your collection page on [GRSciColl](https://scientific-collections.gbif.org/institution/search?country=CH){:target="_blank"}.
- *Records count / est.*: numerical display of the _Progress_, with first the number of records currently present in the dataset on DAGI and second the total number of specimens stated on the collection page on [GRSciColl](https://scientific-collections.gbif.org/institution/search?country=CH){:target="_blank"}.
- *Updated At*: timestamp of the last action executed on the dataset.

Only the Collection Administrators can add (ü™üNew dataset) and edit (üìù) datasets in the Datasets view. The deletion of datasets is available only for the platform admins.


### Dataset page

By clicking on the Name of a dataset (in purple in the Datasets view) the Dataset page opens. There are seven available tabs in a grey bar on top of the page, below the title of the dataset.

- The **Records tab** :<br> View on all imported **records** of the dataset with a selection of important attributes (*Picture availability*, *IUCN tag*, *Typus*, *scientificName*, *verbatimIdentification*, *occurrenceID*, *catalogNumber*, *recordedBy*, *identifiedBy*, *eventDate*, *stateProvince & countryCode*, *verbatimElevation*, *decimalLatitude & decimalLongitude*), the current state of the available actions (*Encoding*, *Publication status*, *Validation status*), the registration status in an Info Species data center (*Swiss Registry*), the *MIDS level* and the *timestamp of the last update of the record*. <br><br>- The tab is divided into two main sections: The **filters** on top (*Quick filters*, *Search bar*, *selected Layer*, *Value filters*) and the **table of records** below.<br><br>- The table of records displays a default set of 15 records  at a time. You can scroll through the records and adjust the number of entries displayed using the navigation tools at the bottom.<br><br>- A summary also appears at the bottom, indicating the current view. For example: _Showing 1 to 15 of 2503 entries_ ‚Äîmeaning that 15 records are currently displayed, starting from the first entry, out of a total of 2503 selected records.<br><br>

- The **Imports tab** :<br> View on all imported **files** of the dataset with a selection of important metadata (*State*, *File*, *Size*, *Created at*, *Created by*, *Started at*, *Started by*, *Records*).<br><br> - The State is either blue (‚öôÔ∏è*In Progress*), green (‚úÖ*Imported*), red (‚ùå*Failed*) or grey (üï∞Ô∏è*Pending*).<br> üî∏When the state is _In Progress_, no other action can be started. You need to wait until it is finished. <br> üî∏When the state is _Imported_, by clicking on the green ‚úÖ*Imported* icon, a side-pane opens on the right of the window and provides information about the file itself, the mapping saved and the unmapped columns.<br> üî∏When the state is _Failed_, by clicking on the red ‚ùå*Failed* icon, a side-pane opens on the right of the window and provides analyses information on the cause of failure. Check our [Error messages page](/en/dagi-error-messages#the-import-failed){:target="_blank"} for a more precise description.<br> üî∏When the state is _Pending_, by clicking on the grey üï∞Ô∏è*Pending* icon, a side-pane opens on the right of the window and provides information on the pending status. By clicking on the üìù*Edit* button in the Mapping section, the mapping pop-up window opens and allows you to proceed further with the import.<br><br> **All imported files, even the failed ones, are kept at all times in the DAGI server**. They are available for download by clicking on the blue icon of the size (üì•*xyz.x Mbyte*).<br><br>

- The **Exports tab** :<br> View on all exported **files** of the dataset with a selection of important metadata (*State*, *File*, *Size*, *Started at*, *Started by* and *Records*).<br><br> - The State is either blue (‚öôÔ∏è*In progress*), green (‚úÖ*Exported*) or red (‚ùå*Failed*).<br>üî∏When the state is Exported, by clicking on the green ‚úÖ*Exported* icon, a side-pane opens on the right of the window and provides information about the file.<br> üî∏When the state is Failed, by clicking on the red ‚ùå*Failed* icon, a side-pane opens on the right of the window and provides analyses information on the cause of failure.<br><br> **All exported files are kept at all times in the DAGI server**. They are available for download by clicking on the blue icon of the size (üì•*xyz.x Mbyte*). Deleting a file in the Exports tab does not delete it from the server, but only from the tab view.<br><br>

- The **Publications and Validations tab** :<br> View on all published or sent for validation **files** of the dataset with a selection of important metadata (*State of the publication/validation*, *Channel concerned*, *File name*, *Size*, *timestamp of the publication*, and *number of records exported in the file*).<br><br> The State is either blue (‚öôÔ∏è*In Publication*), green (‚úÖ*Done*) or red (‚ùå*Failed*).<br>üî∏When the state is Done, by clicking on the green ‚úÖ*Done* icon, a side-pane opens on the right of the window and provides information about the file.<br> üî∏When the state is Failed, by clicking on the red ‚ùå*Failed* icon, a side-pane opens on the right of the window and provides analyses information on the cause of failure.<br><br> **All published/sent for validation files are kept at all times in the DAGI server**. They are available for download by clicking on the blue icon of the size (üì•*xyz.x Mbyte*). Deleting a file in the Exports tab does not delete it from the server, but only from the tab view.<br><br>

- The **Image Upload tab**:<br> View on all uploaded ZIP **files** with images. The metadata provided in this tab is more comprehensive compared to the others, as it includes not only the *State of the upload*, *File name*, *Size*, and *Timestamps of creation and start*, but also the **number of mapped**, **unmapped**, and **invalid images** associated with each file. The *Mapping identifier* is also displayed and can be changed by clicking on the **Edit** action (last element in the far right side of the table).<br><br> The State is either blue (‚öôÔ∏èIn progress), green (‚úÖFinished) or yellow (‚ÑπÔ∏èIncomplete).<br> üî∏When the state is Incomplete, by clicking on the yellow ‚ÑπÔ∏è*Incomplete* icon, a side-pane opens on the right of the window and provides results information on how many images where mapped, unmapped or invalid. By clicking on the blue icon of the size (üì•*xyz.x Mbyte*) of the Logfile section (bottom of the side-pane), a csv file is downloaded with the list of all images in the ZIP file and their matched attribute values.<br><br> **All uploaded files are kept at all times in the DAGI server**. They are available for download by clicking on the blue icon of the size (üì•*xyz.x Mbyte*).<br><br>


#### Filters

The available filters are grouped into 4 categories. It is possible to select as many as you want. The total number of filtered records is displayed live in the purple **Show ... records** button at the bottom of the pop-up window.

## Administration view

<div style="padding: 15px; border: 1px solid transparent; margin-bottom: 20px; border-radius: 4px; color: #a94442; background-color: #f2dede; border-color: #ebccd1;">
‚ùå Only the <i>Collection Administrator</i> role can access this view.
</div>

The Administration view displays **all users already added to your institution**. You can only see the users of your institution. The users are organised by default by order of creation. If you wish to order them differently, you can click on the *Email*, *First name*, *Last name* and *Phone* headers and order them in an ascending or descending order.

The *Roles* column informs you on the role/s attributed to each user:
- **Data Digitizer** (execution role)
  - can view and access the datasets of their institution
  - can [jmport](#import-my-data){:target="_blank"}, [map](#map-my-data){:target="_blank"}, [encode](#encode-my-data){:target="_blank"}, [export](#export-my-data){:target="_blank"} and [send for validation](#validate-my-data){:target="_blank"} the records in the datasets of their institution
- **Collection Administrator** (management role)
  - can view, add, edit and remove users of their institution
  - can view, add and edit datasets of their institution
  - can publish datasets on GBIF.org

‚ö†Ô∏è As the Publication of records on GBIF involves the public responsibility of the institution, we decided to change the users available tasks so that only the Collection Administrator (curators, institution staff member responsible of a collection) can do this important step.
</div>
<br>

For each user, it is possible to edit their profile (üìù) and delete them (üóëÔ∏è).

### Add a new user

1. Click on **üë§‚ûï Add User**
2. Enter the corresponding information in the *First name*, *Last name*, *E-Mail* (‚ö†Ô∏èMandatory‚ö†Ô∏è) and *Phone* (üí°optionalüí°) fields. The institution is automatically set and can't be changed
3. Enter a customed password or click on **Generate Password**.<br>
   ‚ö†Ô∏è*Currently there are no user management, so do not forget to copy the password (by clicking on the üëÅÔ∏è‚Äçüó®Ô∏è icon) and send it manually to the person concerned. The password of a user is available for display only during the creation steps. It is hidden afterwards.*
4. Click on **Next**
5. Click on the toggle switch/es corresponding to the role you want to attribute to the new user (see here above for the definitions).
6. Click on **Next**
7. Check the Summary step and if satisfied, click on **Create user**. The new user is added on top of the list and is moved at the bottom of the list when refreshing the page.
