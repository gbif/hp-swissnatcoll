# How to publish data with the Data Aggregator DAGI

<div style="padding: 15px; border: 1px solid transparent; border-color: transparent; margin-bottom: 20px; border-radius: 4px; color: #31708f; background-color: #d9edf7; border-color: #bce8f1;">
‚ÑπÔ∏è A new version has been recently released on DAGI üéâ This page is in the work to be updated to the new features of this update. We hope you understand if something has not yet been corrected.
</div>

**In order to publish your data on [GBIF.org](https://www.gbif.org/){:target="_blank"}** (‚ö†Ô∏è-currently on the Testing platform of GBIF-‚ö†Ô∏è) **and have it displayed on the SwissNatColl portal**, you need to first prepare an import file with all the data you want to publish (see [Prepare my data](#prepare-my-data) here below).

After preparing it, you are ready to [log in](#log-in) and [import your data](#import-my-data) in the [Data Aggregator (DAGI) app](https://dagi.gbif.ch/sign-in){:target="_blank"}. Then, when done with the [mapping](#map-my-data) and [encoding](#encode-my-data) of your data, the dataset is ready to be [published on GBIF.org](#publish-my-data). From there, it will be displayed on the SwissNatColl portal, in the Occurrence data section (‚ö†Ô∏è-available when publishing on GBIF.org will be effective-‚ö†Ô∏è).

A feature currently in development will also allow you to [send your swiss data for validation](#approve-my-data) to the Infospecies data centers experts.

## Prepare my data

1. Focus on the most important fields first ([Mandatory fields](/en/data-aggregator-faqs#minimal-mandatory-fields-of-the-data-aggregator){:target="_blank"}, [MIDS fields](/en/data-aggregator-faqs#additional-fields-increasing-data-quality-in-the-data-aggregator-mids){:target="_blank"}) and then proceed with the ones you think are important/interesting to be made publicly available.
   - You don't need to import your entire database into the Aggregator. Some of your fields are purely internal management. <br>
2. Make sure the [fields which require special values in DAGI](/en/data-aggregator-faqs#fields-in-the-data-aggregator-with-special-values-required){:target="_blank"} are filled in correctly.
3. Check that your file does not have
   - catalogNumber duplicates
   - empty scientificName or catalogNumber cells
   - duplicated headers (field names) or un-titled columns
   - an unwanted space after a header


Please refer to our [FAQs](/en/data-aggregator-faqs){:target="_blank"} for more details on preparing your data for import into DAGI.

</div>


## Log in
1. Go to the [Data Aggregator DAGI website](https://dagi.gbif.ch/sign-in){:target="_blank"}.
2. Insert your login details in the corresponding fields.
  - After signing in, you have access to your institution page of DAGI, which can be seen only by the users registered in your institution.

There are two different views on your institution page:

  - **[Datasets](#datasets-view)**: displays all the **datasets** of your institution already added in DAGI.
  - **[Administration](#administration-view)**: ‚ö†Ô∏èvisible only to _Collection Digitizers_ ‚ö†Ô∏è, displays all **users** already added to your institution.

Additionnally, there are two icons opening the pages on the SwissNatColl portal with support material to help you using DAGI.

  - **[Guide](#guide)**: opens the *How to publish data with the Data Aggregator* **page** on the SwissNatColl hosted portal (this page)
  - **[Tutorials](#tutorials)**: opens the *Tutorial sessions for the Data Aggregator users* **page** on the SwissNatColl hosted portal

## Add a new dataset

<div style="padding: 15px; border: 1px solid transparent; border-color: transparent; margin-bottom: 20px; border-radius: 4px; color: #a94442; background-color: #f2dede; border-color: #ebccd1;">
‚ùå Only the <i>Collection Digitizer</i> role can add, edit and delete datasets. The steps described in this section are unavailable for users with only the <i>Data Administrator</i> role.
</div>

1. Go to the [Datasets view](#datasets-view) of your institution page by clicking on **Datasets** on the left side of the window.
  - On this page, you can see all the datasets of your institution that have already been added in DAGI. The names of the datasets are based on the [GRSciColl collection names](https://scientific-collections.gbif.org/collection/search?country=CH){:target="_blank"}.
  - You can order the dataset list by clicking on the **columns titles** (_Name_, _Code_, _State_, _Institution Code_, _Institution_, _Progress_, _Records count / est._ and _Updated At_, see the [Datasets view](#datasets-view){:target="_blank"} hparagraph for a precise description). By clicking twice or more, you can order them in an ascending or descending order.
  - The State column informs you of the process step currently running (_Importing_, _Encoding_, _Publishing_, _Deleting_). Unless the State of a dataset is on "üïíReady", no other action can be started until the current one is executed. Depending on the number of records, it can take up to a few hours.
2. If your Datasets view is empty, click either on the **+ New dataset** button in the center of the page or on **ü™üNew dataset** on the top-right corner of the window (it does the same thing at this point).
3. If your Datasets page already has datasets, click on the **ü™üNew dataset** button in the top right corner of the page.

--- A pop-up window _New Dataset_ has opened. ---

1. Select the type of your data. ‚ö†Ô∏è**Mandatory**‚ö†Ô∏è
    - Available types: Zoology, Botany, Geology, Paleontology
2. Select the corresponding GRSciColl Collection of your institution. ‚ö†Ô∏è**Mandatory**‚ö†Ô∏è
    - If the GRSciColl collection has already been added on DAGI, it is not present anymore in the drop-down list of this pop-up window. You can find it on the Datasets view.
3. Add a description of the dataset. üí°optionalüí°
4. Click on **Create dataset**
    - If you change your mind, you can cancel and close the window at any time by clicking on **Cancel**, or edit the dataset afterwards.
    - ‚ö†Ô∏èAvoid deleting a dataset after creating it, especially after publishing on GBIF or it might create unwanted duplicates‚ö†Ô∏è. Please take contact with [contact-swissnatcoll@infofauna.ch](mailto:contact-swissnatcoll@infofauna.ch), so we can advise you correctly.
5. The pop-up window closes itself and places you now on the page of the dataset you just added.
6. You newly added dataset is now visible in the Datasets view.

## Import my data

<div style="padding: 15px; border: 1px solid transparent; border-color: transparent; margin-bottom: 20px; border-radius: 4px; color: #a94442; background-color: #f2dede; border-color: #ebccd1;">
‚ùå Only the <i>Data Administrator</i> can do the following steps, from the import to the publication on GBIForg. The steps described from here on are unavailable to users with only the <i>Collection Digitizer</i> role.
</div>

1. Go to the [Datasets view](#datasets-view) of your institution page by clicking on **Datasets** on the left side of the window.
2. Click on the dataset name in which you want to import your data.
  - For each dataset in DAGI, you have 6 tabs, in a grey bar on top of the dataset page (_Records_, _Imports_, _Exports_, _Publications and Approvals_, _Image Upload_, _Published Records_) (see the [Dataset page](#dataset-page) paragraph for a precise description).
  - The tab **Records** displays the imported **records** available in your dataset.
  - The tab **Imports** displays all the **files** you have imported.
  - The tab **Exports** displays all the **files** you have exported.
  - The tab **Publications and Approvals** displays all the **files** you have published on GBIF.org or sent for approval to the InfoSpecies data centers.
  - The tab **Image Upload** displays all the **files** with images you have imported.
  - The tab **Published Records** displays all the **records** that have been already published.
3. If your dataset is empty, click either on the **+ Import** button in the center of the page, or the **üì§Import data** button in the top-right corner of the window (it does the same thing at this point).
4. If your dataset already has records and you want to add new records or update the existing ones, click on the **üì§Import data** button in the top-right corner of the window.

--- A three-steps pop-up window _Import records_ has opened. ---

1. (Step 1Ô∏è‚É£ of 3Ô∏è‚É£) Click on **Choose a file** to select your prepared .csv/.txt file or drag and drop it if you have a folder window opened on your screen.
2. Wait until the purple bar is full.
3. Click on **Next**

### Map my data

The mappings window (Step 2Ô∏è‚É£ of 3Ô∏è‚É£) has three parts:
- *Quick Start*: if your field names are exactly the same as the DAGI attributes, the mapping can be automatically performed by **‚ú®Try auto-mapping**. The second button **üîÑÔ∏èLoad existing mapping** can be used after the first mapping. It mapps your fields the same way you mapped them previously (as long as your field names do not change).
- *Required attributes*: mandatory attributes that have to be mapped in order to go to the next step. Two attributes are mandatory in DAGI ([scientificName](https://dwc.tdwg.org/terms/#dwc:scientificName){:target="_blank"} and [catalogNumber](https://dwc.tdwg.org/terms/#dwc:catalogNumber){:target="_blank"}).
- *Additional columns*: the other columns present in your import file. The button **‚ûïAdd all** is available for clicking. It adds all of your columns at once. Then you can select the corresponding DAGI attribute for each of them. You can also click directly on the **grey area with the column name** to add them one by one on top of the list of already mapped columns.

1. If your field names are 100% the same as the DAGI's attribute, click on **‚ú®Try auto-mapping**.
2. If you already did a mapping, click on **üîÑÔ∏èLoad existing mapping** and simply check the mapping before clicking on **Update mapping**.
3. If it is your first mapping and your field names are different than the DAGI attributes, select first the Required attributes by clicking on the drop-down menu **Select a column** of both attributes. You can then select the corresponding field in your imported file.
  - By typing the beginning of your field names in the search bar, you can find them more easily.
  - If unsure of the correspondence between the attributes and your field names, consult the Darwin Core FAQs section [Where can I find the Darwin Core terms description?](/en/data-dwc#where-can-i-find-the-darwin-core-terms-description){:target="_blank"}.
4. For the Additional columns, either click on **‚ûï Add all** or add them one by one by clicking on the attribute names (with grey background) to map your fields with the DAGI attributes.
  - The added attributes appear at the top of the Additional columns list when added one by one, and at the bottom of the list when added with ‚ûï Add all.
  - The unmapped fields of your file are listed on top of the Additional columns list with a grey background. It is not mandatory to map all of your file fields.
5. Repeat these steps until all of the fields you want to import are mapped.
  - If you can't find a DAGI attribute corresponding to one or more of your fields, you have the possibility to map it as a "Custom Attribute". ‚ö†Ô∏è Custom Attributes can't be encoded nor published on GBIF but may be available for other features in DAGI (e.g. Approval/Validation process)
<br>
6. When satisfied with your mapping, click on **Update mapping**.
<br>
7. (Step 3Ô∏è‚É£ of 3Ô∏è‚É£) The last step is a summary window on which you can check your file name and size, creation date, the number of rows, and the mapped and unmapped fields.
  - If you want to keep a trace of your mapping, you can select the whole summary window and copy-paste it on your computer. This might also help you keept track of the correspondance between your database field names and the Darwin Core attributes of DAGI.
8. When satisfied, click on **Run import**.
  - The page displayed is now the Imports tab, where you can see all your imported files for a given dataset at all times. By clicking on the blue icon of the size (üì•xyz.x Mbyte), you can download your imported file.
  - A progression bar appears during the import process and disappears when finished. ‚ö†Ô∏è Depending on the size of your imported dataset, this step can take up to a day to be completed ‚ö†Ô∏è Closing your navigator has not impact on the process, you can come back later to check the import state.
  - If the import worked, the State is **‚úÖ Imported**
9. Click on **Records** to see your imported records.
        
<div style="text-align: center; margin-top: 50px; border: 5px solid #000; padding: 20px;">
  <p style="font-size: 20px;"><strong>What you expect to have at the end of the Importing step:</strong></p>
  <p>‚úÖ Your imported records shown in the <strong>Records</strong> tab of your dataset page.</p>
</div>

## Encode my data

<div style="padding: 15px; border: 1px solid transparent; border-color: transparent; margin-bottom: 20px; border-radius: 4px; color: #31708f; background-color: #d9edf7; border-color: #bce8f1;">
<p>‚ÑπÔ∏è <strong>Encoding is not mandatory, though highly recommended</strong> to benefit from the enrichment offered by DAGI.</p>
<p>Despite not needed for publication or approval, supplementary mandatory attributes must be imported, because <strong>GBIF accepts new occurrences under certain conditions and some attributes are important for the correct attribution of a record to a Data Center</strong>.</p>
<p>Here are the supplementary mandatory attributes: <i>kingdom</i> and <i>country</i> (if coordinates are provided with the record).</p>
</div>

1. If you want to encode only a certain set of your data, use the **available filters**.
  - **Quick-filters**: Below the grey tab band, there are four boxes displaying from left to right: the total number of records (**All records**), the percentage and number of not-encoded records (**Not encoded / Incomplete**), the percentage and number of not-published records (**Not published**) and the percentage and number of not-approved records (**Not approved**). By selecting one, you can set a first level of filters.
  - **Search bar**: Below the Quick-filters, there is a search bar (üîçSearch) which allows you to look for specific values in the following attributes : cataloNumber, scientificName and occurrenceID.
  - **üéöÔ∏èFilters**: Next to the search bar, there is this button which opens a pop-up window with available filters for your dataset. Currently, you can filter only the IUCN Red List categories, the MIDS levels, the Taxonomy of the ranks species, kingdom and phylum and the Location at the level of the continents. An improvement of the filters is planned soon.
2. Click on **üß©Encode**.
  - A pop-up window _Encoding Summary_ opens with a short summary of what the encoding does. Briefly said, it uses some fields as query values sent to available dictionaries of data (like GBIF API) to encode the provided values and enrich attributes with new values. It is extremely useful for taxonomic standardisation, georeferencing, species protection, etc. (see [the section on the encoding in the FAQs](/en/data-aggregator-faqs#what-does-the-encoding-do){:target="_blank"} for more details about what it does)
  - If you change your mind, you can cancel and close the window at any time by clicking on **Cancel**.
3. Click on **Encode**.
  - A progression bar appears during the encoding process and disappears when launched. ‚ö†Ô∏è Depending on the number of your records, this step can take up to a day to be completed ‚ö†Ô∏è Closing your navigator has not impact on the process, you can come back later to check the encoding state.
  - During the encoding, no other action can be started.
4. Check the percentage of encoded data on your Dataset page (see the second box called **Not encoded / Incomplete**) in the Quick-filters.
  - By clicking on any **record**, and then on the **Encodings tab** of the side-pane, you can check the encoding state of all catalogs used for encoding and enriching your data (e.g. geo_reverse, swiss_species, gbif_taxonomy, etc.).
  - If the status is "Incomplete", the record is "Not encoded". The reason is displayed when clicking on the yellow **‚ö†Ô∏èIncomplete** icon. It opens the side-pane in the **Encodings tab**.

<div style="text-align: center; margin-top: 50px; border: 5px solid #000; padding: 20px;">
  <p style="font-size: 20px;"><strong>What you expect to have at the end of the Encoding step:</strong></p>
  <p>‚úÖ A <strong>percentage of <i>Not encoded / Incomplete</i> records lower than 100%</strong> in the second Quick-filter box displayed in the <strong>Records</strong> tab of your dataset page.</p>
  <p style="padding: 15px; border: 1px solid transparent; border-color: transparent; margin-bottom: 20px; border-radius: 4px; color: #8a6d3b;; background-color: #fcf8e3; border-color: #faebcc;">
‚ö†Ô∏è If some of your records do not have the necessary information for the APIs queries, then the Encoding status will remain <i>Incomplete</i>. <strong>This does not prevent you from publishing or sending your records for validation</strong>.</p>
</div>

## Export my data

1. Click on **üì•Export**.
  - A pop-up window _Export Records_ opens and is composed of two parts: Data headers and Data layer.
2. **Select your data headers** allows you to determine the column names of your export file. You can choose between your original headers, as imported in the [Import my data](#import-my-data) part, or the Darwin Core (DWC) Attributes, as mapped in the [Map my data](#map-my-data) part.
  - You can select only one at a time. If you want both types, export the records twice.
3. **Select the data layer** allows you to determine which data values you want to export. You can choose between your imported data (Raw), as imported in the [Import my data](#import-my-data) part, or the encoded data (Encoded), as encoded in the [Encode my data](#encode-my-data) part.
   - You can select only one at a time. If you want both types, export the records twice.
6. Click on **Start export**.
  - The page view changes from "Records" to "Exports" where all of your exported files are listed.
  - A progression bar appears during the export process and disappears when finished.
3. Click on the **blue icon** (üì•xyz.x Mbyte) of your export file in the _Size_ column.
  - The file is now saved as a .zip file on your computer (usually in the Dowloads folder or on your Desktop).
4. Go to the zip file on your computer and extract the CSV file it contains.
  - A unique file name for this CSV file has been generated by the Data Aggregator.
  - Your data content is separated by commas.
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è some special symbols (e.g. √§, √º, √°, ...) may not be supported by the export and can be replaced by other symbols. We advise to remove all special symbols from your data before import, or you may need to clean your exported files.


## Upload images

{: .box }
- Only images that can be linked to an **existing record** in your DAGI dataset can be uploaded.<br>
- This feature **is NOT for high definition images**, but for enhancing the visibility of collections who don't have a publicly available image deposit.<br><br>
**If your images are already available online, simply add the url links to your images in the attribute [associatedMedia](https://dwc.tdwg.org/terms/#dwc:associatedMedia){:target="_blank"}.**

<br><br>

1. Prepare a ZIP file containing your specimen images (see [this section in our FAQ](https://swissnatcoll.hp.gbif-staging.org/en/data-aggregator-faqs#can-i-upload-images-in-the-data-aggregator){:target="_blank"}).
- file name = your chosen attribute for mapping (recommended: **catalogNumber**)
- file format = **JPG, JPEG, PNG, BMP, TIFF, SVG or WEBP**
- maximal file size = **5 Mb** (Mo)
- maximale ZIP file size = **200 Mb** (Mo)

2. Click on **Image Upload** in the grey tab band of your dataset, then on **‚ûï Upload Images** in the middle of the page or on **üì§Upload Images** in the top-right corner of the page.

--- A three-steps pop-up window has opened. ---

1. (Step 1Ô∏è‚É£ of 3Ô∏è‚É£) Click on **Choose a file** to select your prepared ZIP file or drag and drop it if you have a folder window opened on your screen.
2. Wait until the purple bar is full.
3. Click on **Next**
4. (Step 2Ô∏è‚É£ of 3Ô∏è‚É£) Select in the drop-down menu **Mapping Identifier** the corresponding attribute to your file names.
5. Click on **Update mapping**
6. (Step 3Ô∏è‚É£ of 3Ô∏è‚É£) The last step is a summary window on which you can check your file name and size, creation date, the number of invalid files, and the mapped identifier.
9. When satisfied, click on **Run Mapping**.
10. You can check the status of your Image Upload
- Incomplete : All or a part of your images remained unmapped. This could be due to the name of the files and the values of the attribute you selected for the mapping. By clicking on the yellow **Incomplete** icon, a side-panel opens with the details of your Image Upload. In the Logfile section, you can click on the **üì• icon** which downloads a csv with the list of all the pictures of your ZIP file and the mapping status and attribute.
- Finished : All of your images could be mapped with a record in your dataset. By clicking on the green **‚úÖFinished** icon, a side-panel opens with the details of your Image Upload. In the Logfile section, you can click on the **üì• icon** which downloads a csv with the list of all the pictures of your ZIP file and the mapping status and attribute.

Now, in the Records tab of your Collection, the records with an image have a green camera icon, and you can see the image when opening the side-panel of a record (only the first image is displayed if multiple images have been mapped to the same record). The link to the DAGI Media Store has been added in the attribute *[associatedMedia](https://dwc.tdwg.org/terms/#dwc:associatedMedia){:target="_blank"}*. When publishing your data, the image will also be displayed on the GBIF occurrence page of your specimen.

# How to navigate in DAGI

When [logging](#log-in) in the Data Aggregator, the platform opens on the [Datasets view](#datasets-view).

In the top-right corner of the page, you can see your login name, the button to log out and the button to choose between light/dark/computer themes. The platform is available only in English.

## Datasets view

The datasets displayed here are the ones that have been added by a Collection Digitizer of your institution. You can only see the datasets of the institution you have been registered to upon creation of your user's profile. The datasets are organised by default by order of creation. If you wish to order them differently, you can click on any of the available headers and order them in an ascending or descending order:
- *Name*: name of your dataset as stated on [GRSciColl](https://scientific-collections.gbif.org/collection/search?country=CH){:target="_blank"} (collection name)
- *Code*: code of your dataset as stated on [GRSciColl](https://scientific-collections.gbif.org/collection/search?country=CH){:target="_blank"} (collectionCode)
- *State*: is green (üïíReady) when the previous action requested is finished and a new one can be done (Actions : [üì§import a dataset](#import-my-data), [üì•export](#export-my-data),  [üß©encode](#encode-my-data), [üåêpublish](#publish-my-data) and [‚úÖapprove](#approve-my-data)).
- *Institution Code*: code of your institution as stated on [GRSciColl](https://scientific-collections.gbif.org/institution/search?country=CH){:target="_blank"} (institutionCode)
- *Institution*: name of your institution as stated on [GRSciColl](https://scientific-collections.gbif.org/institution/search?country=CH){:target="_blank"} (institution name)
- *Progress*: progress bar linked to the number of records already imported and the total number of specimens stated on your collection page on [GRSciColl](https://scientific-collections.gbif.org/institution/search?country=CH){:target="_blank"}
- *Records count / est.*: numerical display of the progress, with first the number of records currently present in the dataset on DAGI and second the total number of specimens stated on your collection page on [GRSciColl](https://scientific-collections.gbif.org/institution/search?country=CH){:target="_blank"}
- *Updated At*: timestamp of the last action executed on the dataset)

Only the Collection Digitizers can add (ü™üNew dataset), edit (üìù) and delete (üóëÔ∏è) datasets in the Datasets page.


### Dataset page

The page of a dataset has 5 available tabs.

- The **Records tab** :<br> View on all imported **records** of the dataset with a selection of important attributes (*Picture availability*, *IUCN tag*, *Typus*, *scientificName*, *verbatimIdentification*, *occurrenceID*, *catalogNumber*, *recordedBy*, *identifiedBy*, *eventDate*, *stateProvince & countryCode*, *verbatimElevation*, *decimalLatitude & decimalLongitude*), the current state of the available actions (*Encoding*, *Publication status*, *Approval status*), the *MIDS quality level* and the *timestamp of the last update of the record*. <br>The tab is separated in two parts: The **filters** on top (*Quick filters*, *Search bar*, *selected layer*, *value filters*) and the **table of records** below. The number of records displayed in the table can be selected at the bottom of the page. The table of records is automatically set in different pages if the total number of records exceeds the displayed number selected.<br><br>

- The **Imports tab** :<br> View on all imported **files** of the dataset with a selection of important metadata (*State of the import*, *File name*, *Size*, *timestamp of the import*, and *number of records imported from the file*). The State is either blue (‚öôÔ∏è*In progress*), green (‚úÖ*Imported*) or red (‚ùå*Failed*).<br> üî∏When the state is Imported, by clicking on the green ‚úÖ*Imported* icon, a side-pane opens on the right of the window and provides information about the file itself, the mapping saved and the unmapped columns.<br> üî∏When the state is Failed, by clicking on the red ‚ùå*Failed* icon, a side-pane opens on the right of the window and provides analyses information on the cause of failure. The red text informs on the number of rows with invalid data and the number of elements with a detected error. By clicking on the blue eye icon (üëÅÔ∏è‚Äçüó®Ô∏è = *Preview error log*) in the Error log section, a pop-up window opens with the catalog number and scientific name of the records concerned by the invalid data, the field containing the invalid data, the value that is invalid and an error message describing why it is invalid. The required changes have to be done in the import file. A new import attempt must be done to proceed further.<br><br> **All imported files, even the failed ones, are kept at all times in the DAGI server**. They are available for download by clicking on the blue icon of the size (üì•*xyz.x Mbyte*). Deleting a file in the Imports tab does not delete it from the server, but only from the tab view.<br><br>

- The **Exports tab** :<br> View on all exported **files** of the dataset with a selection of important metadata (*State of the export*, *File name*, *Size*, *timestamp of the export*, and *number of records exported in the file*). The State is either blue (‚öôÔ∏è*In progress*), green (‚úÖ*Exported*) or red (‚ùå*Failed*).<br>üî∏When the state is Exported, by clicking on the green ‚úÖ*Exported* icon, a side-pane opens on the right of the window and provides information about the file.<br> üî∏When the state is Failed, by clicking on the red ‚ùå*Failed* icon, a side-pane opens on the right of the window and provides analyses information on the cause of failure.<br><br> **All exported files are kept at all times in the DAGI server**. They are available for download by clicking on the blue icon of the size (üì•*xyz.x Mbyte*). Deleting a file in the Exports tab does not delete it from the server, but only from the tab view.<br><br>

- The **Publications and Approvals tab** :<br> View on all published or sent for approval **files** of the dataset with a selection of important metadata (*State of the publication/approval*, *Channel concerned*, *File name*, *Size*, *timestamp of the publication*, and *number of records exported in the file*). The State is either blue (‚öôÔ∏è*In Publication*), green (‚úÖ*Done*) or red (‚ùå*Failed*).<br>üî∏When the state is Done, by clicking on the green ‚úÖ*Done* icon, a side-pane opens on the right of the window and provides information about the file.<br> üî∏When the state is Failed, by clicking on the red ‚ùå*Failed* icon, a side-pane opens on the right of the window and provides analyses information on the cause of failure.<br><br> **All published/sent for approval files are kept at all times in the DAGI server**. They are available for download by clicking on the blue icon of the size (üì•*xyz.x Mbyte*). Deleting a file in the Exports tab does not delete it from the server, but only from the tab view.<br><br>

- The **Image Upload tab**:<br> View on all uploaded zip **files** with images. The metadata provided in this tab is more comprehensive compared to the others, as it includes not only the *State of the upload*, *File name*, *Size*, and *Timestamps of creation and start*, but also details such as the **number of mapped**, **unmapped**, and **invalid images** associated with each file. The *Mapping identifier* is also displayed and can be changed by clicking on the **Edit** action (last element in the far right side of the table). The State is either blue (‚öôÔ∏èIn progress), green (‚úÖFinished) or yellow (‚ÑπÔ∏èIncomplete).<br><br> **All uploaded files are kept at all times in the DAGI server**. They are available for download by clicking on the blue icon of the size (üì•*xyz.x Mbyte*).<br><br>

## Administration view

<div style="padding: 15px; border: 1px solid transparent; border-color: transparent; margin-bottom: 20px; border-radius: 4px; color: #a94442; background-color: #f2dede; border-color: #ebccd1;">
‚ùå Only the <i>Collection Digitizer</i> role can access this view.
</div>

The Administration view displays **all users already added to your institution**. You can only see the users of your institution. The users are organised by default by order of creation. If you wish to order them differently, you can click on the *Email*, *First name*, *Last name* and *Phone* headers and order them in an ascending or descending order.

The *Roles* column informs you on the role/s attributed to each user:
- **Data Administrator** (execution role)

  - can [upload](#import-my-data){:target="_blank"}, [map](#map-my-data){:target="_blank"}, [encode](#encode-my-data){:target="_blank"}, [export](#export-my-data){:target="_blank"} and [publish](#export-my-data){:target="_blank"} the records in the datasets of their institution
- **Collection Digitizer** (management role)
  - can view, add, edit and remove users of their institution
  - can view, add and edit datasets of their institution
 
<br>

| Tasks | Data Administrator | Collection Digitizer |
| ----- | ------------------ | -------------------- |
| **Users** -view/add/edit/remove | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ own institution |
| **Datasets** -view | ‚úÖ own institution | ‚úÖ own institution |
| **Datasets** -add/edit | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ own institution |
| **Records** -upload/mapping/encode/export/publish | ‚úÖ | ‚ùå |

For each user, it is possible to edit their profile (üìù) and delete them (üóëÔ∏è).
