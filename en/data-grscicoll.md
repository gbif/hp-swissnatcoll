# GRSciColl FAQs

## What is GRSciColl?

The [Global Registry of Scientific Collections](https://scientific-collections.gbif.org/){:target="_blank"} is the worldwide catalogue of more than 8,000 institutions, 10'000 collections and 265'000'000 digitized specimens. It makes accessible metadata about institutions and collections, and allows the community to suggest any required changes directly on the website.

## How can I find my institution/collections on GRSciColl?

- On the [GRSciColl main page](https://scientific-collections.gbif.org/){:target="_blank"} you can search your institution, by name or by code.
- By clicking on [Institutions](https://scientific-collections.gbif.org/institution/search){:target="_blank"} in the Navigation bar, you can see a map of the world with all registered institutions. You may navigate in it to reach the location of your institution.

### How can I edit the information about my institution/collections?

On all of your institution and collection pages, the <button>Edit</button> button is available. Clicking on it sends you to the [GBIF Registry](https://registry.gbif.org/){:target="_blank"}, a data management tool for the GBIF network, including GRSciColl. There, the Suggest sliding button allows you to edit information about your institution/collection.

After providing your email and name, as well as the reason of your suggestions, the GBIF Mediator of Switzerland (Staff member of the GBIF swiss node) will review your suggestion. In case of question, they will contact you directly.

### What if I can't find the element I want to edit in the Suggestion system?

Please send us an email at [contact@gbif.ch](mailto:contact@gbif.ch) and explain us the situation.

### How can I add new collections in my institution?

A national collection survey has been done a few years ago. We invite you to use the Guidelines and Matrix available on the [SwissCollNet page](https://swisscollnet.scnat.ch/fr/data_mobilisation/collection_inventory){:target="_blank"}.
