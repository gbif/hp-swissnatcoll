# Import

## The import failed

You can see if an import failed in the **Imports tab of a dataset page**. The State icon on the left side of an import line is red and displays **‚ùåFailed**

1. Click **on the import line** to open the side-pane providing metadata information on the import.
   - In the **Validation section**, you can see how many lines had been checked before finding an error and the total number of errors found in the file.
   - In the **Error Log section**, you can see how many attribute values contain errors.
2. Click **on the blue eye icon üëÅÔ∏è‚Äçüó®Ô∏è in the Error Log section** to open a pop-up window describing the values that contain errors (Preview of the error log).
   The error log is a table of five columns
   - **Catalog Number** : list of the catalogNumbers concerned by the errors
   - **Scientific Name** : corresponding scientificName to a given catalogNumber
   - **Field** : corresponding attribute that contains an error
   - **Value** : corresponding imported value in the attribute
   - **Error message** : standardised explanation on what the error is
3. After identifying the errors in the import file, you will need to correct them and import your file again.

| Example of an error message | Explanation |
| --------------------------- | ----------- |
| _Invalid value provided for [...]_ | The value format of this attribute does not match what was imported in the import file. Check the [Attributes format page](/en/attributes-format){:target="_blank"} for a list of all attributes and their format in DAGI. |
| _attribute tax_scientific_name is required_ | The _scientificName_ is missing in one of the import file lines. |
| _attribute mte_catalog_number is required_ | The _catalogNumber_ is missing in one of the import file lines. |

# Publications

## Unpublished records

When selecting a set of records to publish, it can happen that the number of selected records displayed in the Step 1Ô∏è‚É£ of 3Ô∏è‚É£ of the Publication of Records pop-up window **is smaller than the set of records previously selected**.

1. Publish you dataset
2. After two hours, when the published status of the records are set on "Published*, click on the Quick-filter box **Not Published**.
   - This displays the remaining unpublished records that were missing when you clicked on "Publish".
3. By checking the records, you might find out why they were not published.
   - Is the Encoding status **Incomplete**? Is the GBIF Taxonomy Encoding step **Incomplete**? Then, check the value of _scientificName_.
  
| Example of an error message | Explanation |
| --------------------------- | ----------- |
| _scientificName_ = "Gen. sp." | This value means that the specimen can't be identified. Therefore, the GBIF API can't be completed, leaving the _kingdom_ attribute empty. In this state, this record can't be published |
