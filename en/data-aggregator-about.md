DAGI is the Swiss data aggregator for biological and paleontological specimen data. Designed as a collaborative tool for Swiss natural history institutions, it facilitates dataflows between collections by aggregating, standardising, and enriching the specimen data they supply and host. Through a process of controlled standardisation, DAGI ensures data consistency and interoperability across institutions, thereby improving data quality and usability. By supporting facilitated publication of datasets on [GBIF.org](https://www.gbif.org/){:target="_blank"}, DAGI contributes to increased visibility of Swiss natural history collections on an international scale. Moreover, by providing a shared infrastructure and common data framework, DAGI promotes increased collaboration among institutions, enabling them to collectively advance research, curation, and public access to biodiversity information.

## What is a data aggregator?

A data aggregator is a tool that collects data from multiple and heterogeneous sources and integrates them into a coherent aggregated dataset, which can then be used for research, processing, publishing. Aggregation ensures compliance with the "Interoperability" aspect of the [FAIR principles](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/){:target="_blank"}.

# Target Audience

DAGIâ€™s main users are curators and scientific collaborators from Swiss natural history institutions registered in the Global Registry of Scientific Collections ([GRSciColl](https://scientific-collections.gbif.org/){:target="_blank"}).

# Managing Team
DAGI is currently managed by the GBIF Swiss Node ([GBIF.ch](https://www.gbif.org/country/CH/summary){:target="_blank"}), affiliated to the InfoSpecies data center Info fauna ([infofauna.ch](https://www.infofauna.ch/fr#gsc.tab=0){:target="_blank"}).
_For questions regarding DAGI, please send an email to [contact@gbif.ch](mailto:contact@gbif.ch). We will be happy to provide you answers and support or address you to the correct person._

# Open-source Application

One of the projectâ€™s main goals was to make the entire application open-source. Since July 2025, anyone can view the code on the [GitHub repository of DAGI](https://github.com/zebbra/data_aggregator/tree/develop){:target="_blank"} and suggest changes or improvements. Another key goal was to ensure a modular design, allowing new features to be added easily without disrupting the existing functionality already in use.
