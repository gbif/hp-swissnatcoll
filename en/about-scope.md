[Switzerland’s natural history collections](/collection/search){:target="_blank"} hold more than 60 million specimens, spanning a wide range of disciplines (zoology, botany, mycology, paleontology, geology, and anthropology). About one third of these specimens originate from Switzerland, while the remaining two-thirds come from around the world. This shared heritage, built over more than 300 years, preserves a unique record of biological and geological diversity and serves as an invaluable resource for science and society.
<br>
The SwissNatColl portal provides open access to data on biological and paleontological specimens curated in Swiss institutions. It also offers a direct link to the collections themselves and to the institutions where these specimens are preserved.
To help you navigate the portal, take a look at our short tutorial: [How to find data?](/en/how-to-find-data){:target="_blank"}

# History

The SwissNatColl portal was developed within the [SwissCollNet](https://swisscollnet.scnat.ch/en){:target="_blank"} initiative (2021-2026), a national effort led by the Swiss Academy of Sciences ([SCNAT](https://scnat.ch/en){:target="_blank"}), dedicated to mobilising and providing open access to specimen data from Swiss natural history collections housed in more than 30 institutions across 21 cantons.
<br>
SwissCollNet supported 68 large-scale inter-institutional and inter-cantonal projects that modernised and digitised over one million specimens. It brought together a wide network of people and institutions, strengthening connections and fostering knowledge sharing. A major outcome of this initiative, carried out in collaboration with several key stakeholders, was the creation of a data infrastructure comprising two components:

- The **data aggregator** called [DAGI](/en/aggregating-data/){:target="_blank"}, which gathers, standardises, enriches and publishes data from Swiss collections.
- The **SwissNatColl portal**, which provides easy and free access to the published specimen data via a single, user‑friendly interface.

Together, the DAGI aggregator and the SwissNatColl portal constitute a national data infrastructure that enhances the visibility, collaboration and research on Swiss collections.
