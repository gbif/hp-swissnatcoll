# Description
The Swiss Natural History Collections (SwissNatColl) provides **open access to harmonized specimen data from the Swiss collections** for researchers, data providers, curators, collection-holding institutions and customers from the cantons and the federal administration in Switzerland, as well as citizen scientists. As a result, it is hoped the collections will gain increased public visibility.
