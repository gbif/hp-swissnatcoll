  We cannot find the page you are looking for 😵‍💫<br>
  
  But here is a fun fact to compensate:<br><br>
  
    🐜🌲🪨🏛️<br>

    The homepage image has been chosen because it encompasses all of the museum main subjects: This ant (_zoology_) in amber (_geology_), which is fossilised (_paleontology_) tree resin (_botany_), is a naturally curated specimen and now part of the [Museum d'histoire naturelle de Genève](http://institutions.ville-geneve.ch/fr/mhn/){:target='_blank'} collection.<br>
    
    Museums are open doors through time! 🚪🕰️<br><br>

<!-- For a limited time, the Lausanne Musée cantonal de géologie (today: [Naturéum](https://zoologie.vd.ch/museum-cantonal-des-sciences-naturelles/)) created chocolate replicas of their most famous fossils. -->
<!-- Sweet tooth meets paleontology! -->
